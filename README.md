# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to help Omar and Pyber with their assignment to create a summary Dataframe of their ride sharing data as well as to create a visualization that shows total weekly fares for each city type to help V. Isualize with her decision making. Since the data that we needed was given was in two spreadsheets, we had to combined both after that. Once combined all we had to do was to get the necessary data by city type as that was what was requested, and manipulate it to make a new Dataframe. To create the visualization, we needed plot they necessary values into a graph and since we were asked to look for in a certain timeframe, we had to again manipulate the data and then plot it on a line graph as that is best type of graph for timeframes.

## Results

### Dataframe of the Ride Sharing Data

As expected the total number of rides was far greater in Urban cities (1625) than in the Suburban cities (625) or in the Rural cities (125) in fact Urban almost doubles Surburban as it has 1000 more rides, and it is 13 times more that Rural with a difference of 1500. Surbuban is only 5 times more than rural with a difference of 500 rides. Just like total rides, the total number of drivers were also seen more in Urban(2405) than in Suburban(490) and Rural(78) in fact the difference was far more as there was almost 5 times more drivers in Urban than Surburban with a difference of 1915 and almost 31 times more that Rural with a difference of 2327. Surburban also had a bigger difference than Rural with more than 6 times more and a difference of 412. If there are more rides it would make sense that the total fares would increase and therefore the standing is the same as Urban($39,854.38) leading with Surburban($19,356.33) a little less than half of Urban and finally Rural($4,327.93) being almost 5 times less than Surburban and a little bit more than 9 time less than Urban. While Urban might rule the total stats, the per averages are flipped, for average fare per ride, Rural($34.62) is the largest than with almost 4 dollars less we have Surburban($30.97) and with a little more than 10 dollars less than Rural and a little more than 6 dollars less than Surburban we have Urban($24.53). Its the same with average fare per driver but with a bigger difference as Rural($55.49) is almost 16 dollars more than Surburban($39.50) and almost 39 dollars more that Rural($16.57), Surburban also increased its difference by having a total difference of almost 23 dollars more that Rural.

### Total Fare by City Type

By looking at the graphy we can see that with our earlier finding that Urban had the most total fares than Surburban followed by Rural, the difference is that now we can see that there is constantly a greater numbers of fares is Urban than Surburban followed by Rural at least from Jan 1st, 2019 to April 29th, 2019, so now we know there was not one week or one day that grealy effected the outcome of total fares.

## Summary

Based of these results we could help V. Isualize or the CEO by telling them to show the Urban drivers the average fare per drivers coloumn, this would hopefully make some urban drivers, drive to rural or suburban places, this would decrease the number of drivers in urban, decreasing the supply and therefore we can increase the prices to make more in urban places, this has to be only urban driver to see this because that is the only place where total drivers is more tha total rides, or in economic terms where supply is more than demand. Another thing that could help is if there was a discount for urban to suburban/rural places and vice versa, this would help the point about the drivers made before but the drive back would increase the total rides, drivers, and fares for rural and suburban cites. Lastly, I would advise them to change the price of fare based of the time of the month this could be for all three types or just one for instance next Feburay at the end of the month they can increase the prices as all three line increase around that time or they could decrease the prices in rural places near the beginning of Janurary as rural was the only one that saw a decrease during that time.
